Unichain | The L2 designed for DeFi. By Uniswap.

Evaluating the effectiveness of Unichain's MEV framework (maybe mention Rollup-Boost and Flashblocks), quantifying how much MEV is redistributed to users versus captured by others, and comparing these metrics to other L2 solutions.

# Project Topic: "MEV Internalization Efficiency and User-Centric Risk Assessment on Unichain"

## Statement of Problem

Unichain introduces a novel MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) internalization framework via its Rollup-Boost mechanism and Flashblocks (enabled by a Trusted Execution Environment, TEE), aiming to redistribute MEV profits to users rather than searchers or validators. While this promises enhanced fairness and reduced transaction costs for DeFi users, the white paper acknowledges potential inefficiencies, such as incomplete MEV capture, adverse selection risks, and the need for iterative optimization (e.g., BatchPoster contract adjustments). Investors and LPs need clarity on whether this system effectively mitigates traditional MEV risks (e.g., front-running, sandwich attacks) and delivers tangible benefits, especially given Unichain’s 200-250 ms block times and cross-chain ambitions. Without quantitative evidence, there’s a risk of over-centralized MEV leakage or user dissatisfaction, undermining Unichain’s DeFi-native value proposition.

## Objectives

Quantify MEV Distribution: Measure the proportion of MEV (e.g., arbitrage, liquidations, sandwich attacks) captured and redistributed to users versus retained by validators or lost to searchers.
Evaluate Mitigation Effectiveness: Assess how Unichain’s TEE-driven Flashblocks and Rollup-Boost reduce MEV-related risks compared to traditional rollups or other L2s.
Analyze User Impact: Determine the net benefit to users in terms of transaction cost savings and fairness, identifying any inefficiencies or risks (e.g., front-running persistence).
Monitor Protocol Neutrality: Track whether MEV internalization maintains Unichain’s neutrality or inadvertently favors certain actors (e.g., validators with high UNI stakes).


## Key Metrics to Track and Insights

Metric
Description
Insight Provided
 - MEV Type Breakdown per Flashblock
- Volume and value of MEV types (arbitrage, liquidations, sandwich attacks).
- Identifies dominant MEV risks affecting users.
- MEV Tax Redistribution Rate
- Percentage of MEV tax redistributed to users vs. captured by validators/searchers.
- Measures user benefit and fairness of allocation.
- Front-Running Incident Rate
- Frequency of front-running detected pre/post TEE revert protection.
- Assesses mitigation effectiveness against MEV attacks.
- Transaction Cost Savings
- Reduction in gas fees or slippage costs attributable to MEV internalization.
- Quantifies financial benefit to users and LPs.
- Validator MEV Share vs. Stake
- Correlation between UNI stake concentration and MEV profits for validators.
- Flags risks of validator favoritism or centralization.
- Transaction Failure Rate
- Rate of failed transactions linked to MEV or TEE issues.
- Highlights operational risks impacting user trust.

Answers a Quantitative Risk Analyst Can Provide to Investors and LPs

Based on the metrics tracked via a Dune dashboard, a quantitative risk analyst can address common investor and LP questions with data-driven insights:
“Does Unichain’s MEV system actually benefit liquidity providers and traders?”
Answer: “Our analysis shows that X% of MEV profits (e.g., $Y daily) are redistributed to users via the MEV tax, reducing transaction costs by Z% compared to Ethereum L1 or other L2s like Arbitrum. However, sandwich attacks still account for W% of MEV, suggesting room for improvement.”
“How effective is Unichain at reducing predatory MEV practices?”
Answer: “Front-running incidents have dropped by X% since TEE revert protection was implemented, outperforming traditional rollups by Y%. However, during peak volumes, failure rates rise to Z%, indicating congestion risks.”

“Is my investment safe from validator collusion or centralization?”
Answer: “Validators with the top 10% of UNI stakes capture X% of MEV profits, but the Gini coefficient of stake distribution is Y, suggesting moderate decentralization. No significant collusion patterns detected yet.”
“What’s the financial upside for LPs on Unichain?”
Answer: “LPs benefit from an average cost saving of X gwei per transaction due to MEV internalization, translating to an estimated Y% boost in yield over 30 days, assuming current volume trends hold.”
“Are there hidden risks we should worry about?”
Answer: “While MEV leakage to searchers is low at X%, transaction failures linked to TEE latency spikes occur in Y% of Flashblocks under high load, posing a minor but manageable risk to reliability.”

Additional Information to Ensure Research Success

## Data Availability and Sources:

Use Unichain’s on-chain data (e.g., block logs, transaction receipts, validator stakes, MEV tax allocations) via Dune’s SQL engine. Since Unichain is in its early phase (testnet as of October 2024), start with Unichain Experimental testnet data and transition to mainnet once live.
Supplement with comparative data from other L2s (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum) via Dune’s multi-chain support for benchmarking.

## Methodology:

Statistical Analysis: Calculate averages, variances, and percentiles for cost savings and failure rates; use correlation analysis for validator stake vs. MEV share.
Time-Series Tracking: Monitor metrics daily/weekly to detect trends or anomalies (e.g., MEV spikes during market volatility).
Visualization: Build Dune dashboards with line charts (e.g., cost savings over time), pie charts (e.g., MEV type breakdown), and scatter plots (e.g., failure rate vs. volume).
Challenges and Mitigations:
Data Gaps: Early-stage networks may lack robust historical data. Mitigate by simulating MEV scenarios using testnet activity or historical L2 data.
TEE Opacity: TEE internals are hard to audit directly. Use attestation failure logs and Flashblock performance as proxies for security risks.
Volume Dependency: Low initial transaction volume may skew results. Normalize metrics per transaction to ensure scalability insights.


## Collaboration and Tools:

Collaborate with Unichain’s open-source community (e.g., GitHub rbuilder) for TEE insights or MEV taxonomy.
Use Dune’s query-sharing features to validate findings with other analysts and refine SQL logic.
Future-Proofing:
Incorporate white paper’s planned upgrades (e.g., BatchPoster optimization) into metrics as they roll out, ensuring the dashboard evolves with Unichain’s development.
